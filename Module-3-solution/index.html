    	<p id="title"class="text-center">CHICKEN<p>
	    <p>
	    	Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world. Owing to the relative ease and low cost of raising them in comparison to animals such as cattle or hogs, chickens have become prevalent throughout the cuisine of cultures around the world, and their meat has been variously adapted to regional tastes. Edible components
			Breast: These are white meat and are relatively dry.
			Leg: Comprises two segments: The "drumstick"; this is dark meat and is the lower part of the leg, the "thigh"; also dark meat, this is the upper part of the leg.
			Wing: Often served as a light meal or bar food. Buffalo wings are a typical example.Humans raised fowl for cockfights starting in Southeast Asia and China as early as 10,000 years ago, but their meat wasn't enjoyed until later. Now researchers investigating an ancient city in Israel have found what they think is the earliest evidence that chickens were kept for food.The reason chicken is always included in a healthy diet is because it is basically a lean meat, which means it doesn't have much fat. So, eating chicken regularly can actually help you lose weight in a healthy way. Apart from protein, chicken is also chock full of calcium and phosphorous

    	<p id="title" class="text-center">SUSHI</p>
    	<p>
    		Sushi is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice, usually with some sugar and salt, accompanying a variety of ingredients, such as seafood, vegetables, and occasionally tropical fruits.Today I found out sushi is not raw fish, that's sashimi. Sashimi is just sliced raw fish, sometimes dipped in sauces and sometimes served with sushi. Sushi is any food dish consisting of vinegared rice, usually served with some other toppings, but not always.Can sushi kill you? Sushi has many benefits due to its source of low-calorie, high quality protein. It has many fatty acids that can lower your cholesterol, as well as your risk of heart disease. Eating sushi is not detrimental to one's health, unless they eat it too often.Some people — including pregnant women, young children, older adults, and those with weakened immune systems — may need to completely avoid sushi made with raw fish. SUMMARY Sushi made with raw fish may contain harmful bacteria and parasites. Improper food processing and handling increase your risk of contamination.
    	<p id="title" class="text-center"> BEEF </p>
    	<p>
	    	Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle, particularly skeletal muscle. Humans have been eating beef since prehistoric times. Beef is a source of high-quality protein and nutrients.Almost all beef in developed countries is from steers (castrated males) and heifers (females that have never been bred). Bulls that are not castrated are kept for breeding and not for meat, and once a cow is too old for breeding or for milk production, her meat is going to be far too tough for most human palates.Beef is meat from a cow. It's also a word for a complaint. If you have a beef with someone, you're not sharing a steak, you have a gripe. ... The word beef comes from the Old French word buef, which became the word for basically, cow meat. Beef is to cow as pork is to pig or mutton is to sheep.In general, red meats (beef, pork and lamb) have more saturated (bad) fat than chicken, fish and vegetable proteins such as beans. Saturated and trans fats can raise your blood cholesterol and make heart disease worse. The unsaturated fats in fish, such as salmon, actually have health benefits.Most whole meat beef is steers (castrated males) as it grows fastest and has better flavor and texture. The others end up as other beef products. Bulls are also used for food (just like cows). A non-fighting bull is usually slain when he is 18 months old because he is at his tastiest.
	    	Slaughter: 'They Die Piece by Piece'
			After they are unloaded, cows are forced through a chute and shot in the head with a captive-bolt gun meant to stun them. But because the lines move so quickly and many workers are poorly trained, the technique often fails to render the animals insensible to pain.
